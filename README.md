In this project I believe skills learned so far will be put together to create a basic
website with recipes. I will come back at the end of the project to reflect on how it went and write down the skills I demonstrated by completing the project.

REFLECTIONS AFTER FINISHING THE FIRST PROJECT:

In this project I got more practical experience on how working on a project might 
look like, even though it was the first project and obviously practice was the 
simplest possible. I learned how to add template, headings, paragraphs, images, 
links (both absolute and reelative) and lists (ordered and unordered). I learned some basics of GIT - hot to make a commits, while I will need time to get intuitive feeling on how often I should make commits and what exactly to write in them.
Everything in the project was done in basic HTML, which proved to be rather simple. Despite some fear and feeling of inedequacy, part of me is looking forward to do more 
challanging projects.
