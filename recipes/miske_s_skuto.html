            and leave to drain for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, rum,  
            baking powder, salt and zest. Make a well in the middle add the 
            egg and ricotta.</li>
        <li>Mix together with a fork or spatula the ingredients almost come 
            together. Move the mixture to a lightly floured flat surface and 
            gently knead a few times to form a soft compact dough. The dough 
            will be a little sticky but do not add extra flour, lightly dust 
            hands with flour while kneading. Cover the dough with a tea towel 
            and let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove small pieces of dough and form into balls the size 
                of a chestnut.</li>
            <li>In a medium high sided pot add about 3 inches of oil, heat 
                the oil to 340F (175C), keep the temperature as close to 
                this as possible.</li>
            <li>Fry 3-4 castagnole at a time, turning to fry golden brown on 
                both sides. Two minutes on each side should be enough time. 
                Remove them with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined plate, 
                leave for a few seconds then roll in granulated sugar. 
                Place on a clean plate and serve immediately.</li>

            paper.</li>
        <li>Place the castagnole on the cookie sheet and bake for about 12-15 
            minutes or until golden brown. Let cool and dust with icing sugar.</li>
