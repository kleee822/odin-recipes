        <li>butter (45 g /3 Tbsps)</li>
        <li>corn tortillas (10-12)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>(Suggested Toppings)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>lettuce - sliced</li>
        <lI>salsa</lI>
        <li>guacamole</li>
        <li>sour cream</li>
        <li>red onions - sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If your lentils are not already cooked, cook them while you prepare 
            the toppings. 
            <p>Simmer 1 cup of dried black lentils + 3 cups of water for 20-25 
                minutes until soft but al dente. Drain if necessary, but no 
                need to rinse.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>In a large pan saute your onions in olive oil over medium heat until 
            soft.
        </li>
        <li>Add the butter and the spices and saute over a low heat until the 
            spices are just starting to release their scent - then take of the 
            heat. We want to make sure the butter and spices don't burn.
        </li>
        <li>Add the lentils to the pan and continue to simmer over a low 
            heat for a few more minutes. I like to smush some of the lentils 
            with a wooden spoon while cooking to add some creaminess, but this 
            is optional. If it feels too dry for your liking, you can add 
            additional butter or a little vegetable stock.
        </li>
        <li>Heat your tortillas - for this recipe I like to lightly fry 
            mine in oil until slightly crisp but still malleable. You can heat in 
            the microwave or in a dry pan if you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>As soon as the tortillas are heated, it's time to serve! Add a 
            scoop of lentils and your desired toppings to each tortilla, and 
            dive right in.
        </li>
    </ol>
