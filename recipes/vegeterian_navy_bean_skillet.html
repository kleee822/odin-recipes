    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>red onion - thinly sliced (1)</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes - halved (225 g)</li>
        <li>garlic (3 cloves)</li>
        <li>fennel seed - crushed (1/4 tsp)</li>
        <li>smoked paprika (1/4 tsp)</li>
        <li>sage - dried (1/2 tsp)</li>
        <li>white wine (1/4 cup /60 ml)</li>
        <li>navy beans - cooked (1.5 cups/270 g)</li>
        <li>feta cheese - crumbled (100 g)</li>
        <li>sage leaves - fresh (10)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a layer of olive oil in your skillet. Add the onions and 
            cook over a medium heat for about 10-15 miutes. We want them 
            reduced and soft, but starting to crisp up a little at the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Add the garlic to the pan and cook until soft</li>
        <li>Add the fennel seeds and cook for about 30 seconds, until 
            the fragrance is released and then add the smoked paprika and dried 
            sage. Mix through to coat the onions.
        </li>
        <li>Add the cherry tomatoes to te pan and continue to cook 
            for a few moments until they start to break down and 
            release their liquid.
        </li>
        <li>Add the white wine and stir through. It will bubble up 
            and help un-stick anything that's getting stuck on the 
            bottom of the pan before being absorbed by the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the beans to the pan along with a little bit of the 
            cooking water, just enough to keep the skillet moist.
            Simmer for about 5 minutes, allowing the beans to absorb 
            the flavor. Use a wooden spoon or potato masher to break 
            down and mash some of the beans if you'd prefer a more 
            creamy finish. Add salt and pepper to taste - especially 
            important if you're using canned beans. Once the beans have 
            cooked down to the texture you like, remove from the heat 
            and stir the feta through.
        </li>
        <li>If you are using the fried sage garnish, prepare that now. 
            In a small saucepan or frying pan, heat a little butter or 
            olive oil and fry the sage briefly until crisp (about 30 
            seconds should od it). Remove from the heat immmediately and 
            pour into a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Top the beans with fried sage anf server.</li>
    </ol>
